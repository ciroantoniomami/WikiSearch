	    <p>I personally think that we should not emphasize the use of E Prime on this SEWiki. I think that most contributors won't be familiar with the idea, and we won't want to make too many new rules distinguishing our <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_English_f1f8.html" title="Simple English">Simple English</a> from <a href="../../../f/u/l/Full_English_ee46.html" title="Full English">Full English</a>. Personally, I advocate something like "expanded <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basic_English_33a0.html" title="Basic English">Basic English</a>". Comments? -- <a href="../../../r/j/w/User%7ERJWiki_76d0.html" title="User:RJWiki">RJWiki</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>It's not a question of the needs of contributors, but of readers. English speakers use "is" far too much, one of the reasons <a href="../../../e/_/p/E_Prime_4cc6.html" title="E Prime">E Prime</a> was created, and this use tends to lead to serious subject-object problems in almost all English non-fiction writing. There's no "rule" here. It's just "encouragement" to be clearer about what becomes, remains and equals what. Rather than using "is" in contexts where equivalence is uncertain.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Does the "Simple English" Wikipedia even HAVE readers? It has lots of contributors, but I don't think anyone actually uses it. It's just a pet project for contributors. That's who it's really for.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As far as I know, no <a href="../../../e/a/l/EAL_6100.html" title="EAL">EAL</a> learners and users will be learning <a href="../../../e/_/p/E_Prime_4cc6.html" title="E Prime">E Prime</a>. As far as I know, most languages (and all of the ones with many users) have the verb "to be" (or "ser" and "estar" in <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish.html" title="Spanish">Spanish</a>, etc). I don't want to add an additional artificial and strange guideline in the SeWiki -- RJWiki</dd>

<dl>
<dd>NO ONE HAS TO TALK ABOUT A "NEW LANGUAGE" called <a href="../../../e/_/p/E_Prime_4cc6.html" title="E Prime">E Prime</a> just to use "become, remain, equal" MORE and "to be" LESS. It has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE END USER. It is an editor's concern.</dd>

<dd>You aren't making sense to me here. 1) I meant that E Prime's de-emphasis of "to be" is, by comparison with existing languages, artificial, idiosyncratic, and weird. I didn't say that E Prime is or should be called a new language.</dd>

<dd>Only if it IS a new language, do your objections make sense. There is nothing idiosyncratic or weird about replacing <a href="../../../t/o/_/To_be.html" title="To be">to be</a> with become, remain and <a href="../../../e/q/u/Equal.html" title="Equal">equal</a>. In fact, it is to get rid of idiosyncratic beliefs and statements that one does that. You need to learn more about General Semantics. Each language has its own mind set. English culture makes it acceptable to say "he is taking his time" (implying that time is an object that can be taken), something which makes no sense in most other cultures. Saying "he remains patient" says something more objective. Both are English. Only one is <a href="../../../e/_/p/E_Prime_4cc6.html" title="E Prime">E Prime</a>. The latter is easier to translate.</dd>

<dd>"expanded <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basic_English_33a0.html" title="Basic English">Basic English</a>" implies "beed" and "bes"? No thanks. It just isn't English, and that's even more confusing.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't advocate "beed" and "bes", no. Ouch. &#160;:-) -- RJWiki.

<dd>There is no such thing like "beed" and "bes" in Basic English. It's a misunderstanding.Hansjörg</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The <a href="../../../e/_/p/E_Prime_4cc6.html" title="E Prime">E Prime</a> thing can be dealt with later by Simple English Editors who can make the hard decisions about "is" vs. "becomes, remains, equals", case by case.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This probably should be discussed in Simple English/Talk, not here.</dd>
</dl>
<p>And again, I don't want to emphasize the distinction between SEWiki "users" or "readers" and "contributors". They are potentially (ideally?) the same. -- RJWiki</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, they aren't. That is completely wrong, and it always will be. The contributors will *always* have a better grasp of English than the users. *Always*. That will *never* change. This puts the Simple English Contributor and Simple English Editor in a position of power over the Simple English User. We can't wish that out of existence, we have to deal with it. They are only "ideally" the same to those whose ideals are preaching equality while practicing control over others. They are only "potentially" the same to those who could believe in creating <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_English_f1f8.html" title="Simple English">Simple English</a> as a peer to <a href="../../../f/u/l/Full_English_ee46.html" title="Full English">Full English</a>, with people spending their whole lives ONLY reading and writing Simple. I might buy that, but it sure isn't the mandate right now.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Look, I just don't agree with you about this. (I.e., "No, <b>you</b> are completly wrong about this!"&#160;:-) ) Or, we disagree about the emphasis to put on different aspects of this. I think we both agree that now and always, "anybody" can contribute to this SEWiki, which makes them contributors and thus means that "anybody" is a potential contributor. Re "people spending their whole lives ONLY reading and writing Simple". Obviously, there will be people for whom this is <i>true</i>.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>IF there is ever any ONE such person, it will be amazing. I think your lack of agreement is really a lack of thinking here - you're digging for a proof of something you want intuitively to believe. Sure, "anybody CAN contribute" and be a nominal "contributor". But without a good grasp of English, they really aren't going to be "ideal" contributors, or even necessarily become "good" unless they acquire MORE THAN SIMPLE English. It just isn't possible to get to this level of mastery without picking up much more vocabulary. If they're using a computer, they pick up other words from the user interface at least! And none of this has anything at all to do with the users and contributors *potentially or ideally* being the same people, *statistically*. There will still always be many more people in the user group with less skill than the people in the contributor group, even if there is crossover. It's those statistical averages that are at issue.</dd>

<dd>I cannot answer to your lack of comprehension.

But you said "Re "people spending their whole lives ONLY reading and writing Simple". Obviously, there will be people for whom this is true." I answered to this - do not pick out a different point from what you wrote to make yourself right. I said there are NO people who will spend their whole lives ONLY reading and writing Simple without learning more English by osmosis or default or job requirements or whatever. That is, I do not expect <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_English_f1f8.html" title="Simple English">Simple English</a> to be a language of its own like <a href="../../../e/s/p/Esperanto.html" title="Esperanto">Esperanto</a>.

<p>"But without a good grasp of English, they really aren't going to be "ideal" contributors, or even necessarily become "good" unless they acquire MORE THAN SIMPLE English." -- Yes. So what? Many contributors to En Wiki aren't "ideal" or "good" either. So what? It's not our place to be gatekeepers about who can/can't/should/shouldn't contribute. In fact, it's stupid of us to even try, since we can't accomplish this. -- RJWiki</p>

<dd>There will be other people who go through a stage of being Simple users (broadly speaking), while learning more Full.

<dd>Initially, yes. But they are overwhelmed by literally millions of times by the users who will see printed copies only, CD copies only, or just read it online without ever contributing. The number of users in your position are statistically insignificant. And always will be. I repeat, it will *never* be an equal power situation, for the *vast majority* of <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_English_Users_8a5b.html" title="Simple English Users">Simple English Users</a>. So your comfort with a statement that seems to imply most users aren't contributors, is not really relevant. If we were writing this for you, we'd be writing it without all this Simple stuff...</dd>

<p><br />
I think this entry should have some examples to help the idea sink in before delving into the comparisons to other systems. At the very least, the comparison to Basic English with the confusing 'beed' stuff should be moved to a separate paragraph from the definition; like the comparison to Simple English.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I think there is a misunderstanding what Basic English is. There are no such word as "bees" or "beed" in Basic English. The point is that Basic English <b>counts</b> the different irregular forms of English as <b>one</b> word. So <i>be, are, is, am, was</i> are just considered as one word. So are e.g. <i>man, men</i> - <i>I, we</i> - <i>he, she, it, they</i> and some more. It is one of the tricks by which the number of words is reduced to merely 850. <i>Hansjörg from German Wikipedia</i></p>
<p><br />
<i>The Basic Dictionary</i> by C.K. Ogden, 1932, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 4-590-00862-9</a>, page 8.</p>
<p><b>become</b>, v. <i>Basic words.</i></p>
<p>In any <i>Webster's Dictionary</i>. <b>become</b> /is/ made from BE + COME</p>
<p>Also, <b>been</b> /is/ past participle of BE</p>
<p>For these reasons, by both Basic and Full English, the E-Prime words of <i>become</i> and <i>been</i> must be taken from the E-Prime word list. <i>Become</i> has /been/ put forward on many E-Prime pages and <i>been</i> /is/ not yet on the keep-out list.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I said there are NO people who will spend their whole lives ONLY reading and writing Simple without learning more English by osmosis or default or job requirements or whatever.</i> Oh, really? One of the target audiences for SEW is <b>people with learning disabilities</b>. A fair number of these folks will never progress past a basic level of reading/writing in any language. Furthermore, even people without learning disabilities but who learn to read and write as adults may find it exceptionally difficult to progress beyond a basic literacy level. Does limited/impaired literacy mean that people have nothing to contribute? I think Albert Einstein would disagree. <a href="../../../o/h/s/User%7EOhSusanne_a9a0.html" title="User:OhSusanne">OhSusanne</a> 23:39, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Somebody said that this article wasn't simple enough. I've simplified it now but didn't use a word list so it might not conform to Simple English's rules. Feel free to revert it or change it if it's not. 81.159.121.205 14:05, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Does E Prime replace every instance/case/form of "to be" with the words "becomes", "remains", and "equivalent"? Can someone provide an example of a sentence in E Prime? It seems to me like it would sound extremely awkward, let alone be incorrect. Is that what's best for ESL/non-fluent English speakers to be exposed to? It would be confusing, not helpful. "To be" is quintessential to English, so take it or leave it. You can simplify the language, but not modify it to an incorrect form. It sounds absurd, or maybe I just don't understand what it is.64.12.116.201 00:35, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This entry was scarily inaccurate. I have edited it to reflect information generally available about E Prime and will add cites later.</p>
<p>I find it curious that a substantial debate has been waged on this page about whether E Prime rules should be incorporated into SEW without much discussion of what E Prime actually is. It's not a beginners' English, nor was it conceived as a way to eliminate the passive voice in English writing. E Prime is a linguistic manifestation of General Semantics. Most people (regardless of language) don't even know what General Semantics <b>is</b> and they'd heartily disagree with any attempt to take the concept of "being" out of general use.</p>
<p>Actually, GS philosophy is completely at odds with the creation of an encyclopedia, period. If nothing is really "real"-- if all we can be sure of are our own perceptions -- then what business do we have creating a document that states, unequivocably, that an octopus has eight arms or the sky is blue or that there are one-billion-and-something people in China?</p>
<p>In any event, do we really need to involve some child trying to write a report on sea turtles in this navel-gazing, bong-passing discussion? "The sea turtle equals a marine lizard....It remains an egg-laying animal....It appears to have been hunted to near extinction.."</p>
<p>Moreover, it is laughable to say that English uses <b>far too many</b> forms of the verb "to be". Far too many for whom? Is there some sort of international standard? And, speaking of international standards, could everyone please sign their posts -- it's very confusing to read through the discussion above. <a href="../../../o/h/s/User%7EOhSusanne_a9a0.html" title="User:OhSusanne">OhSusanne</a> 23:20, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
