<p>Simple English was only put on the new software on December 18, so there remain some things to be fixed.</p>
<p>Still to be fixed:</p>
<ul>
<li>fix links</li>
<li>fix and add interlanguage links</li>
<li>upload pictures and replace the existing image links</li>
</ul>
<p>Mostly complete:</p>
<ul>
<li>remove the /talk links from articles</li>
<li>move talk pages to the talk namespace</li>
<li>move user pages to the user namespace</li>
<li>move user talk pages to the user talk namespace</li>
<li>move capitalised titles to proper title names</li>
<li>move Wikipedia pages to the Wikipedia namespace</li>

<p>I went throught WP Simple English and I was appalled by its condescendence! [For those non familiar: condescendence is a dominating attitude, someone thinking he is superior tries to help, but he is more rude than really usefull because he sounds despising.]</p>
<p>We agree that the section should be written by people at ease with English, for non-native English speakers -- with access to Internet. Believe it, among those, there are some people who don't know a 1000 words of English, but who rule a whole country and would beat any logical GRE score of yours. Why explain to them that:</p>

</dl>
<p>as if you were adressing a retarded person?</p>
<p>Maybe you were aiming at simple-minded Americans, with access to Internet, in need of a dictionnary. If they come across a word they don't know, I think they would rather turn to someone around or a dedicated paper-dictionary.</p>
<p><a href="../../../i/m/h/IMHO_c339.html" title="IMHO">IMHO</a>, most "simple:" users are (should be) native-language users, who look for a definition they cannot understand using Google, because of vocabulary. This suppose we should look actively for links toward the others WP -- links I do not see at all. Remember we are addressing people like you, with less vocabulary, that is all. Anyhow, people who would not get that&#160;:</p>

<dd>As a tutor working on a voluntary basis with adult students, most of them orally fluent in English, I find this site a blessing. If you have ever worked with an adult literacy project, you will understand how very, very hard it is to find material that is both of interest and at a satisfactory reading level. I think the whole argument of "condescension" is a little suspect in any case. I studied French for a number of years, and even as an adult, I did not find "la plume de ma tante" offensive - it was just material I could read. I believe those coming to this project with respect for their readers will naturally be sensitive to how condescending they sound. Just my 25¢ worth. DWindrim 20:35, 19 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The same happens on our main page because of the spaces between letters in the title. So, I've replaced the spaces with nbsp to stop individual words being split up when it wraps.

<p>I removed Esoterism and Spatial science b/c, despite my ready grasp of English (and my studies of physics and philosophy), I could not tell you what these things are. They also have no simple articles written about them. I also added two- and three-word descriptions of some topics which are difficult to grasp.

<p>Where possible, I will be bringing articles from the existing Wikipedia and modifying the vocabulary level. However, the process leaves the new page bleeding red. I'm sure the regulars here have given this some thought -- how do you want to handle it? Delink judiciously, leave the words linked as they come, create stubs? I have no real preference, though I like the first choice least, and would do the latter if I didn't see the need to get some real content happening here. Thoughts? <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenniW_09ae.html" title="User:DenniW">Denni</a> 04:02, 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think Wikipedia should aim high and we should aim for all of these articles to be created, someday. I think that Simple should have more links than <i>en</i>, because a lot of the users will fail to understand some basic words.<br />
<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonMayer_3dd3.html" title="User:SimonMayer">SimonMayer</a> 21:17, 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree. Link everything that could possibly need to be linked, and we'll worry about articles later. If people are reading and find a red link we can hope they would go and fill it in if they could, so red links should increase article creation. Whether or not to create stubs is another matter, I personally like stubs, once you have a stub people can just add a line at a time until you have a big article, before the stub is created those same people will ignore it. The other side to the arguement is that red links make it clear an article needs work, blue links to stubs don't. -- <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 21:59, 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Good point, Tango. It also allows the possibility of doing something here that isn't happening on the main Wikipedia. I think it's unfortunate the Wiktionary has become a separate entity; I'd much prefer a seamless interface. So, for instance, an article might look like this:</p>
<p><a name="Article" id="Article"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../m/a/i/Talk%7EMain_Page_Archive3_efc0.html" title="Edit section: Article">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Article</span></h2>
<p>An <b>article</b> is a <a href="../../../w/r/i/Writing.html" title="Writing">written</a> <font color="#886600"><u>description</u> <font color="#000000">of a <a href="../../../p/e/r/Person.html" title="Person">person</a>, place, or thing.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#886600"><font color="#000000"><br />
The blue links are standard wikilinks to articles. The yellow links would link to a definition in the Wiktionary, (which would appear in a pop-up window) and the red links would allow creation of either an article or a definition. Ultimately, it would be nice to have both articles and definitions available through a pop-up dialog/left-right mouseclick/click-click&amp;hold, or whatever. I can see someone wanting to look up the meaning of, say. <i>philosophy</i> without running into a 3000 word article on Freud and Jung. Am I asking way too much of Wikipedia? Of course! But a person's reach should always exceed her grasp. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenniW_09ae.html" title="User:DenniW">Denni</a> 01:02, 21 Apr 2004 (UTC)</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#886600"><font color="#000000">You are asking much, but right on target! There is a hypertext editor called [<a href="http://www.webcom.com/~thinker/" class="external text" title="http://www.webcom.com/~thinker/" rel="nofollow">Thinker</a>] in which every word can be used as a link target. It should be possible to do this using HTML only, while not underlining and highlighting every word. This relieves the author of explicitly marking up every occurrence of intended link targets and still lets the reader use every such occurrence. It should still be the norm to explicitly mark up relevant references for the reader's benefit. Whether Thinker gives any indication of whether there is a page at the end of the link, I do not know. A disadvantage would probably be the size of the HTML (times four, maybe). A better technical solution than using HTML href anchors would be to have the browser implement this. The "invisible" default link for each word should point to the dictionary entry for that word. This might be user-customizable, so that the links point to an interlanguage instead of to an intralanguage dictionary. Additional functionality for explicitly marked-up words might be attached to little graphical symbols or letters following the reference, as the asterisk in "Xyz*". Rainer</font></font></p>

When I wrote that I assumed you meant the links were at the top and bottom of the screen, which is why it showed three times, but then I realized it was probably due to duplication in the interlanguage links.
