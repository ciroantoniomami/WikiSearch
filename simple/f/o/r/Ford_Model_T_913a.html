<p>The <b>Ford Model T</b> was an <a href="../../../a/m/e/American.html" title="American">American</a> <a href="../../../c/a/r/Car.html" title="Car">car</a> built between <a href="../../../1/9/0/1908.html" title="1908">1908</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/2/1928.html" title="1928">1928</a> by the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Motor_Company_7541.html" title="Ford Motor Company">Ford Motor Company</a> of <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit%2C_Michigan_ae78.html" title="Detroit, Michigan">Detroit, Michigan</a>. It is one of the most important cars in history because it was one of the first cars to be sold for very little <a href="../../../m/o/n/Money.html" title="Money">money</a>, making it easy for people to <a href="../../../t/r/a/Travel.html" title="Travel">travel</a> from place to place.</p>

<p>Before the Model T, most cars cost lots of <a href="../../../m/o/n/Money.html" title="Money">money</a>. Only people with lots of money could afford them. Even Ford's cars before the Model T cost a lot of money. A car built in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1903.html" title="1903">1903</a> called the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Oldsmobile.html" title="Oldsmobile">Oldsmobile</a> Curved Dash was very easy to buy, but was a very simple and slow car that was more like a buggy than a car.</p>
<p>The man who owned the company, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Ford_8fe5.html" title="Henry Ford">Henry Ford</a>, heard about <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meat.html" title="Meat">meat</a> being packed on an assembly line, which moved meat from <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worker.html" title="Worker">worker</a> to worker so that the meat could be cut up. No one had ever thought to use an assembly line to put cars together. Ford knew that if he built his cars on an assembly line instead of one at a time like other cars, he could make a car that anyone could afford and would be built like cars that cost more money. He also knew that he could pay his workers lots more money.</p>
<p>The Ford Model T car was designed by Henry Ford, Childe Harolde Wills and two <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hungary.html" title="Hungary">Hungarian</a> men named József Galamb and Eugene Farkas. The Model T had a 177 cubic inch (2.9&#160;L) four-cylinder engine producing 20 horsepower (15 kW) for a top speed of 45 <a href="../../../m/i/l/Mile.html" title="Mile">miles</a> per hour (72 km/h). The engine had side valves and three main bearings. Fuel economy was 25 to 30 miles per gallon (11 to 13 km/l), an excellent number even today.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Model_T_913a.html" title="Edit section: The beginning of the Model T">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The beginning of the Model T</span></h2>
<p>Ford began building the Model T in his Piquette <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factory.html" title="Factory">factory</a> on October 6, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1908.html" title="1908">1908</a> as a <a href="../../../1/9/0/1909.html" title="1909">1909</a> model. Workers from all over the world wanted to work for Ford because of the good pay. Workers could even save their money for a Model T of their own! The price of the Model T dropped over the years, making it even easier to buy.</p>
<p>Work began at one end of the assembly line, starting with an empty chassis. From there, the chassis moved slowly down the assembly line. Workers on the assembly line added parts to the chassis. Before long, a new Model T rolled off the other end of the line. Different <a href="../../../b/o/d/Body.html" title="Body">body</a> styles were available, even a <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truck.html" title="Truck">truck</a>, or Model TT. At first, the only color available was black. Black paint of the day dried faster than other colors of paint, which meant that Ford could build his cars faster and not have to wait for paint to dry. As car paint got better over the years, Ford began offering other colors. The time it took a chassis to become a finished car was over twelve hours when the first Model T's were built. By the time the last Model T came off of the line, Ford was producing one car every 27 seconds!</p>
<p>Even though the Model T sold for little money, Ford used the best materials he could buy to make his car. Most roads in the Model T's day were dirt, gravel or even mud. That meant the Model T had to be very strong, and it was. The wheels and tires were very tall and skinny so that they could sink into mud roads and not get stuck. It was also very simple. Almost anyone could fix the Model T and take care of it, too. This is why many Model T cars are still here today.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Model_T_913a.html" title="Edit section: How to drive a Model T">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">How to drive a Model T</span></h2>
<p>Ford made the Model T easy to drive compared to today's cars since the people he sold his cars to did not know how to drive anything other than a <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horse.html" title="Horse">horse</a>. It is not like driving a modern car, even though there are three pedals on the floor like a modern manual transmission car. A Model T has a <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steering_wheel.html" title="Steering wheel">steering wheel</a> that works the same way as in cars of today, but almost everything else is different.</p>
<p>The first Model T's didn't even have a starter like a modern car. This is the powerful <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric.html" title="Electric">electric</a> <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motor.html" title="Motor">motor</a> in a car that turns the <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engine.html" title="Engine">engine</a> to make it run when it is turned off. The engine on the Model T was started with a hand crank on the front of the car. A wire loop near the radiator worked the choke on the carburetor to give the engine extra fuel to help start it when it was cold. This could be dangerous if you were not careful. If the levers that controlled the engine were not set the right way, especially the spark control, the engine could backfire, or spin the wrong way. Many people got broken arms this way. <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor.html" title="Doctor">Doctors</a> even had a special name for this kind of break: the "Ford Fracture." Many Model T owners added electric starters to their cars and it was not long before Ford started doing the same. A Model T is in high gear by default, so if the Parking/Clutch lever was not engaged, the car had a tendency to run over the operator when started.</p>
<p>To make a modern car go or accelerate once the engine is running, you step on a pedal on the floor to engage the transmission into low gear. To make a Model T accelerate, you moved two <a href="../../../l/e/v/Lever.html" title="Lever">levers</a> near the steering wheel. The lever on the right was the throttle (or engine speed), and the lever on the left adjusted the time that the spark plugs fired. These levers needed to be set properly before the engine could be started.</p>
<p>The three pedals on the floor of the Model T were for the <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brake.html" title="Brake">brake</a> on the right, reverse in the middle to make the Model T go backwards, and a pedal on the left to shift the gears from low to high speed. A lever on the floor worked the brakes as well as the clutch. Pulling the lever toward you would set the parking brake and help keep the car from moving while parked. When the lever was placed in the middle, the transmission would ne in <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutral.html" title="Neutral">neutral</a>.</p>
<p>Once the engine is running, you now have to make the Model T move on its own. Step on the pedal all the way to the left, move the throttle lever to "give it the gas" and gently move the floor lever forward. This is low gear, the powerful gear used to get the Model T moving. Once it's moving, move the right lever up, let the left pedal come all the way up, and give it more gas to shift into high. To make the car go faster still, move the throttle lever as well as the spark advance lever. Stepping on the left pedal only halfway puts the car in neutral, the same as the lever. This helps the Model T come to a stop without causing the engine to stop as well.</p>
<p>Model T trucks had a low/high rear end. In low, the car is slower but has more torque power. In high, the car moves faster but has less torque power. This can be changed by moving a lever to the right of the driver while in neutral.</p>
<p>The brakes on a Model T work the rear wheels by the use of brake bands inside the transmission. Modern cars have brakes on all four wheels. No brakes are on the front of a Model T.</p>
<p>More than fifteen million (15,000,000) Model T cars were built. It was not until <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a> that the record was broken by the <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volkswagen.html" title="Volkswagen">Volkswagen</a>. Today, the record for the most cars built is held by the <a href="../../../t/o/y/Toyota.html" title="Toyota">Toyota</a> Corolla.</p>
<p>The Model T was nicknamed the "Tin Lizzie" and "Flivver" by the people who drove it. A new car took the place of the Model T in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1928.html" title="1928">1928</a>, the Ford Model A.</p>
