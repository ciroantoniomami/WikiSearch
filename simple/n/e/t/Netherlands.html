<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Edit section: Name">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Name</span></h2>
<p>"The Netherlands" means "the low lands". They are called that way because the land is very flat, and only rises a little bit above the sea level. One third of the land is below sea level. The Netherlands are also sometimes called <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holland.html" title="Holland">Holland</a>. Holland was a very rich area in the western part of the Netherlands. Some people who do not live in the western part of the Netherlands do not like it when people call the country Holland. Holland means "wooded land" because the Holland area used to be covered with forests.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>At the end of the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_Ages_99b9.html" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> the <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke.html" title="Duke">dukes</a> of <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burgundy.html" title="Burgundy">Burgundy</a>, a country that is now part of <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, united seventeen areas. Those areas were called the Netherlands. When the daughter of a duke married the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King.html" title="King">king</a> of <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a>, the Netherlands became part of Spain. In the <a href="../../../1/6/t/16th_century.html" title="16th century">16th century</a> many Dutch people became <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protestant.html" title="Protestant">Protestant</a>. The kings of Spain did not like it, they wanted all Dutch to be <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_3b40.html" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>. He decided that all protestants should be killed. Of course the Dutch people did not like this, and in <a href="../../../1/5/6/1568.html" title="1568">1568</a> they started a war against Spain. The war lasted until <a href="../../../1/6/4/1648.html" title="1648">1648</a>, therefore it is called the <a href="../../../e/i/g/Eighty_Years%27_War_1f74.html" title="Eighty Years' War">Eighty Years' War</a>. An important leader of the Dutch in this war was <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_the_Silent_7502.html" title="William the Silent">William the Silent</a>.</p>
<p>In 1648 the Netherlands and Spain signed peace. The Dutch people were allowed to keep all the areas they conquered. The part of the Netherlands that was not conquered by the Dutch stayed part of Spain. Later this part became the country <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>.</p>
<p>When the Netherlands became independent, it was a very special country. That time almost all countries in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> were ruled by a king, but the Netherlands weren't. The Netherlands existed of seven <a href="../../../p/r/o/Province.html" title="Province">provinces</a>, that were ruled by civilians. Together those provinces were ruled by a stadtholder, but he did not have much power. In the <a href="../../../1/7/t/17th_century.html" title="17th century">17th century</a> the Netherlands were the richest and one of the most powerful countries in the world. Therefore the Dutch call the 17th century the Golden Age. They had possessions all around the world. The most important possession were the East Indies, a country that is now called <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indonesia.html" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>. The Dutch also founded the city <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>, but they called it New Amsterdam. The Netherlands often fought wars against other European countries, especially against <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michiel_de_Ruyter_61cf.html" title="Michiel de Ruyter">Michiel de Ruyter</a>, a Dutch admiral, became a Dutch hero when he defeated the English navy close to London.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../1/8/t/18th_century.html" title="18th century">18th century</a> the Netherlands became poorer. Many people thought this was the fault of the stadtholders. Many thought they had too much power and wanted them to get away. In <a href="../../../1/7/8/1789.html" title="1789">1789</a> the French people deposed their king. French armies attacked other countries to depose their leaders too. In <a href="../../../1/7/9/1795.html" title="1795">1795</a> they attacked the Netherlands. Stadtholder William V had to flee to England. The Netherlands were renamed to Batavian Republic and became a <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy.html" title="Democracy">democracy</a>. But the French were not content with the Dutch ruler, so in <a href="../../../1/8/0/1806.html" title="1806">1806</a> the French <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emperor.html" title="Emperor">emperor</a> <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleon.html" title="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> made his brother <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Bonaparte_3bd5.html" title="Louis Bonaparte">Louis Bonaparte</a> king of the Netherlands. Louis became popular in the Netherlands, but the emperor was again not content with him, so in <a href="../../../1/8/1/1810.html" title="1810">1810</a> the Netherlands became a part of France.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/1/1815.html" title="1815">1815</a> Napoleon was defeated, and the Netherlands became independent again. The rulers of European countries thought it was a good idea to make the Netherlands stronger, to make them able to resist another French invasion. Therefore <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgium.html" title="Belgium">Belgium</a> and <a href="../../../l/u/x/Luxembourg.html" title="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a> were added to the Netherlands. William I, the son of stadtholder William V, became king. The Belgians were not happy with the Dutch king. In <a href="../../../1/8/3/1830.html" title="1830">1830</a> they revolted. William sent an army, but it was defeated by the Belgians. In <a href="../../../1/8/3/1831.html" title="1831">1831</a> the Belgians chose their own king, and Belgium became an independent country.</p>
<p><a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberalism.html" title="Liberalism">Some people</a> thought the Dutch king had too much power. They wanted to give him less power and vote for the government theirselves. In <a href="../../../1/8/4/1848.html" title="1848">1848</a> there were violent revolts against the kings of many European countries. The Dutch king was afraid the same would happen in the Netherlands. Therefore he allowed <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johan_Rudolf_Thorbecke_c8ad.html" title="Johan Rudolf Thorbecke">Johan Rudolf Thorbecke</a> to write a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution.html" title="Constitution">constitution</a>. From then on people were allowed to vote. At first only rich men were allowed to vote. From <a href="../../../1/9/1/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a> on <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_suffrage.html" title="Universal suffrage">everyone was allowed to vote</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, the Netherlands did not fight. The Dutch wanted to stay neutral in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> as well, but in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a> the country was invaded and occupied by <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>. Just like in other countries they had occupied, the Germans started to kill <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jews.html" title="Jews">Jews</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Frank_85bb.html" title="Anne Frank">Anne Frank</a> was a Jewish girl who lived in the Netherlands. She died in a German <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concentration_camp.html" title="Concentration camp">concentration camp</a>. When she and her family were hiding for the Germans, she wrote a diary. After the war her diary became very famous. In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a> the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canadian</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Polish</a> and <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">English</a> armies liberated the south of the Netherlands from the Germans. They wanted to cross the <a href="../../../r/h/i/Rhine.html" title="Rhine">Rhine</a> river to liberate the rest of the country, but they were defeated by the Germans. It took until <a href="../../../m/a/y/May.html" title="May">May</a> <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a> before the entire country was liberated. During the five years of German occupation, 250,000 people had died in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Shortly after the war, Indonesia declared its independence. The Dutch sent soldiers to Indonesia. During the war the Dutch realized how it is to be occupied by another country, so some people thought the Dutch should not do the same to the Indonesians. After other countries, including the United States, told the Dutch to leave Indonesia, they finally did so (<a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a>).</p>
<p>After the war the Netherlands became one of the richest countries in the world. In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> said the Netherlands were the 5th best country to live in.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Edit section: Geography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>
<p>In fact a large part of Holland was created by the sand that came from the many <a href="../../../r/i/v/River.html" title="River">rivers</a> flowing through it. Notable Dutch rivers are the <a href="../../../r/h/i/Rhine.html" title="Rhine">Rhine</a>, the Maas, the IJssel and the Scelt. A large part of the Netherlands is below <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sea_level.html" title="Sea level">sea level</a>. This is because the Dutch have made many lakes and parts of the sea dry, creating polders. Therefore there is a saying in the Netherlands "God created the earth, except the Netherlands. Because the Netherlands were created by the Dutch themselves." This makes the Netherlands very flat. The highest point in the Netherlands, the Vaalserberg, is 321 metres above sea level.</p>

<p>The Netherlands are a small country, but many people live there. It is one of the most densely populated countries of the world.</p>
<p>Most people in the Netherlands speak <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_language.html" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a>. In <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friesland.html" title="Friesland">Friesland</a> about 200,000 people speak <a href="../../../f/r/i/Frisian_language.html" title="Frisian language">Frisian</a>. Frisian is the language with the most similarities to English. Some Dutch people speak <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialect.html" title="Dialect">dialects</a>. The Saxon dialects spoken in the north eastern part of the Netherlands are somewhat similar to Lower German.</p>
<p>According to a survey done in 2006, 25% of the Dutch people are <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> and 3% believe in an other organised religion, like Judaism, Islam or Hinduism etc. 26% are 'unbounded spiritual' (have their own beliefs and are not tied to a religion). The other 44% are not religious.</p>
