<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../s/a/m/Samurai.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The samurai's importance and influence grew during the Heian Period, when powerful landowners hired private warriors for the protection of their properties. Towards the end of the Heian Period, two military clans, the Minamoto and Taira, had grown so powerful that they seized control over the country and fought wars for supremacy against each other.</p>
<p>In 1185, the Minamoto defeated the Taira, and Minamoto Yoritomo established a new military government in Kamakura in 1192. As shogun, the highest military officer, he became the ruler of Japan.</p>
<p>During the chaotic Era of Warring States (sengoku jidai, 1467-1573), Japan consisted of dozens of independent states which were constantly fighting each other. Consequently, the demand for samurai was very high. Between the wars, many samurai were working on farms. Many of the famous samurai movies by Kurosawa take place during this era.</p>
<p>When Toyotomi Hideyoshi reunited Japan, he started to introduce a rigid social caste system which was later completed by Tokugawa Ieyasu and his successors. Hideyoshi forced all samurai to decide between a life on the farm and a warrior life in castle towns. Furthermore, he forbade anyone but the samurai to arm themselves with a sword.</p>
<p>According to the Edo Period's official hierarchy of social castes, the samurai stood at the top, followed by the farmers, artisans and merchants. Furthermore, there were hierarchies within each caste. All samurai were forced to live in castle towns and received income from their lords in form of rice. Masterless samurai were called ronin and caused minor troubles during the early Edo Period.</p>
<p>With the fall of Osaka Castle in 1615, the Tokugawa's last potential rival was eliminated, and relative peace prevailed in Japan for about 250 years. As a result, the importance of martial skills declined, and most samurai became bureaucrats, teachers or artists.</p>
<p>In 1868, Japan's feudal era came to an end, and the samurai class was abolished.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../s/a/m/Samurai.html" title="Edit section: Weapons">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Weapons</span></h2>
<p>Samurai were able to use many weapons, such as <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spear.html" title="Spear">spears</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bow_%28weapon%29.html" title="Bow (weapon)">bows</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arrow.html" title="Arrow">arrows</a>, and <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gun.html" title="Gun">guns</a>. However, their most famous weapon, a long <a href="../../../s/w/o/Sword.html" title="Sword">sword</a> called a <i><a href="../../../k/a/t/Katana.html" title="Katana">Katana</a></i>, was their <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symbol.html" title="Symbol">symbol</a>.</p>
<p>A samurai carried two swords. In peace-time, he carried a <i>Katana</i> and a short sword, <i><a href="../../../w/a/k/Wakizashi.html" title="Wakizashi">Wakizashi</a></i>. In war-time, he carried a long sword, <i><a href="../../../t/a/c/Tachi.html" title="Tachi">Tachi</a></i> and a short sword, <i><a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanto.html" title="Tanto">Tantō</a></i>. He wore less armor than <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knight.html" title="Knight">knights</a> from <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../s/a/m/Samurai.html" title="Edit section: Beliefs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Beliefs</span></h2>
<p>A samurai believes that his swords hold his <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul.html" title="Soul">soul</a>, so they became the most important thing he has.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the samurai were allowed to fight anybody who did not show them proper respect. Every sword had to be tested; to do this, the owner of the sword could <a href="../../../e/x/e/Execution.html" title="Execution">execute</a> a criminal. With this method the warrior was able to test his sword's sharpness. Samurai lead their lives according to the <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethics.html" title="Ethics">ethic</a> code of <i>bushido</i>, which translates as <i>the way of the warrior</i>. This implies loyalty to one's master, self-discipline and respectful, ethical behaviour. When a samurai lost his master, also called <i>Daimyo</i>, he was called a <i><a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronin.html" title="Ronin">Ronin</a></i>.</p>
<p>After a defeat, the samurai chose to commit <a href="../../../r/i/t/Ritual.html" title="Ritual">ritual</a> <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide.html" title="Suicide">suicide</a>, which is also called <i>Seppuku</i>. In this ritual they cut their <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stomach.html" title="Stomach">stomach</a> before the <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy.html" title="Enemy">enemy</a> was able to capture them, in the case of a war. In Europe, this ritual is mistaken for <i>hara-kiri</i>. Hara-kiri means "to cut the stomach". In other words, hara-kiri refers only to the action done by Seppuku and not the whole ritual. Seppuku was a more honourable death for a samurai than being captured by the enemy. Another reason to commit Seppuku was the death of the Daimyo. With this ritual, a samurai was able to show how loyal he was to his (dead) master. There were periods when Seppuku was forbidden, but despite the bans there were samurai who still committed it.</p>
<p>The bushi's training methods like <a href="../../../m/e/d/Meditation.html" title="Meditation">meditation</a>, judo and <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kendo.html" title="Kendo">kendo</a> are still followed today. Although the samurai do not have official recognition in modern Japan, the successors of these families are well respected.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../s/a/m/Samurai.html" title="Edit section: Samurai women">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Samurai women</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japanese</a> women had a specific role in Japanese society. Most of them were taking care of house and crops and raising children. They were a few women who were samurai. One of the most famous Japanese samurai women was Itagaki. She lived during the end of the Heian period (<a href="../../../7/9/4/794.html" title="794">794</a> – <a href="../../../1/1/9/1192.html" title="1192">1192</a> <a href="../../../a/d/_/AD_e182.html" title="AD">AD</a>) and owned her own army of about 3000 warriors. In <a href="../../../1/1/9/1199.html" title="1199">1199</a>, Itagaki , fought against 10.000 Heike soldiers. She was very good in handling <a href="../../../n/a/g/Naginata.html" title="Naginata">naginata</a> <a href="../../../s/w/o/Sword.html" title="Sword">sword</a>, which made her very famous.</p>
<p>Samurai women were also trained to defend themselves and their children. They usually did it while their warrior husbands were engaged in battles. The samurai wife was called okusan (in translation "one who remains at home"). This is why samurai women were trained to handle polearms (naginata) and short daggers (<a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanto.html" title="Tanto">Tanto</a>). During the Edo period (<a href="../../../1/6/0/1600.html" title="1600">1600</a>-<a href="../../../1/8/0/1800.html" title="1800">1800</a> AD), Japanese women were trained to handle naginata by the age of 18. The short kaiken knife was used by the young women to defend their virtue, or to take their own life in case they lost it.</p>
<p>The Japanese women, especially the samurai wives, were very respected. They possessed qualities that made them a important part of Japanese society. They were obedient, self-controlled, loyal, responsible, etc. They were skilled in dance, food preparing, arts, children education, care for relatives and all persons who lived in her house (including servants. A good Okusan also had to deal with property managing, financial and other records. The samurai women were also very disciplined, never expressed too much feelings. By religious laws (Confucian) a woman should be subdued to her husband; while her husband takes care of his wife and children. Wifes of rich samurai were very well dressed and enjoyed a good position in society. They were not participating in physical labor. All women were not allowed to involve in <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics.html" title="Politics">politics</a> or warfare.</p>
<p>Of course, there were women who were powerful. For example, in Muromachi period, the wife of Ashikaga Yoshimasa (1449 – <a href="../../../1/4/7/1474.html" title="1474">1474</a>, 8th <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shogun.html" title="Shogun">shogun</a>), Hino Tomiko ruled in his place. The Toyotomi Hideyoshi's (<a href="../../../1/5/3/1536.html" title="1536">1536</a> – <a href="../../../1/5/9/1598.html" title="1598">1598</a>) mistress became the real master of <a href="../../../o/s/a/Osaka.html" title="Osaka">Osaka</a> castle after his death. Yamauchi Kazutoyo's (<a href="../../../1/5/4/1545.html" title="1545">1545</a> – <a href="../../../1/6/0/1605.html" title="1605">1605</a>) wife, Chiyo, was one of the most loyal wifes known in Japanese history. Her power was of another kind, she supported her husband during hard times, saving to buy a horse for her husband. Yamauchi Kazutoyo never took a mistress, though it was a known tradition for samurai, and didn't leave Chiyo despite the fact that she couldn't have more children than one (a girl, Yone).</p>
<p>During Tokugawa Era (<a href="../../../1/6/0/1603.html" title="1603">1603</a> – <a href="../../../1/8/6/1867.html" title="1867">1867</a>) the women education became very important. Girls were taught to write, read, dance, etc. beginning at a young age. The main criteria for marriage changed. Among the most important were: physical attractiveness and education. There were created special books for women. They mainly taught how to take care of house and children. But by the end of Tokugawa period women attended philosophical and literary classics.</p>
