It first aired in October of 1999. Like <i>Buffy</i>, it was produced by Whedon's production company, Mutant Enemy.</p>
<p>The series tells the story of the vampire Angel. Angel had his <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soul.html" title="Soul">soul</a> returned to him as <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punishment.html" title="Punishment">punishment</a> for <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kill.html" title="Kill">killing</a> a <a href="../../../g/y/p/Gypsy.html" title="Gypsy">gypsy</a> girl.

(Not all "demons" in the <i>Angel</i> universe are evil beings.) The fifth season saw Angel taking over as the person in charge of the law firm Wolfram and Hart. This was done to try to fight evil from the inside.</p>

<p>Several years before the <i>Angel</i> first showed on television, writer Joss Whedon created the idea behind <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i> to change the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> <a href="../../../f/o/r/Formula.html" title="Formula">formula</a> of "the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every horror movie."<sup id="_ref-blondegirl_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-blondegirl" title="">[2]</a></sup> Whedon was not happy with the way that the <i>Buffy</i> idea was first done in the 1992 movie, <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>,<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup>. He was given the chance to do the story better with the television series of the same name.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup> The early years of the series were about the life of Buffy Summers, a <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_school.html" title="High school">High-School</a> aged Vampire Slayer, and her group of friends in Sunnydale (a <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fiction.html" title="Fiction">fictional</a> small town in <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>). The <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supernatural.html" title="Supernatural">supernatural</a> parts in the series took the place of the real problems that are a part of <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolescence.html" title="Adolescence">adolescence</a> and young <a href="../../../a/d/u/Adult.html" title="Adult">adulthood</a>.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[5]</a></sup> The <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_character.html" title="Fictional character">character</a> Angel, was first seen in the first episode, he became a regular cast member during the second/third seasons. In the fictional universe created by <i>Buffy</i> (the Buffyverse),<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[6]</a></sup> Angel was born in <a href="../../../1/8/t/18th_century.html" title="18th century">18th century</a> <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>. After being turned into a souless immortal vampire, he became very well known for the evil things he did. Over 100 years later, Angel killed a gypsy girl. Her <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family.html" title="Family">family</a> punished him by returning his soul. He felt a very large <a href="../../../a/m/o/Amount.html" title="Amount">amount</a> of guilt for what he had done over all those years. Angel evenutally began on a path of redemption. He hoped that he might make up for his past by doing good deeds. In the <i>Buffy</i> third season final episode, Angel leaves Sunnydale for Los Angeles to continue his path of redemption without Buffy. Whedon believed that "Angel was the one character who was bigger than life in the same way that Buffy was, a kind of superhero."<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>While the main idea behind <i>Buffy</i> was "High school as a horror movie" in small-town America<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[8]</a></sup>, Greenwalt and Whedon wanted to make <i>Angel</i> into a different "gritty, <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban.html" title="Urban">urban</a> show".<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Joss Whedon and David Greenwalt created a short <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video.html" title="Video">video</a>, often called the "Unaired Angel pilot" for the WB <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_network.html" title="Television network">Network</a>.
