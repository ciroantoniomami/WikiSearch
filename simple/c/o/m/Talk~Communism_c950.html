<p>I agree, but we would need a lot more information, and considering that this is the simple english wikipedia, that would take a lot of very careful work, and probably quite a few years. --<a href="../../../q/m/w/User%7EQmwne235_43ca.html" title="User:Qmwne235">Qmwne235</a> 21:08, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think that maybe these different versions of Communism should have their own pages, like on the Big Wikipedia.</p>

<p>I'm concerned that the following paragraph might not be NPOV</p>
<p>"The goal of communism is for the people to own everything in the country, and for everyone to work to help everyone else. Many people like this idea, but of course, many people don't want to work to help everyone else. They would rather work to help themselves. And some people don't want to work, they want other people to work for them."</p>
<p>While it's probably true, the little snipes, particularly in the last sentence, may not be appropriate, I feel.</p>
<p>"The Soviet Union was the first country to make their goal the creation of a Communism. But the country never became Communist in the way that Marx described, it was an attempt at a Socialist Transformation of Society which ultimately failed. This can be confusing, because many people called the Soviet Union a Communist country, even though many socialists and communists don't want the kind of "socialism" that existed in the Soviet Union - which they call Stalinism"</p>
<p>This paragraph is confusing, and seems to be biased.</p>
<p>"In 1924 Lenin died, and after a power struggle Josef Stalin became the leader of the Soviet Union in the 1930's he proclaimed that the USSR was a Socialist Country and his warped model, which completely contradicted both Marx and Lenin's idea that a Socialist Revolution had to be worldwide in order to create a Communist Society, and that 'Socialism in one Country' was not possible, became known as Communism."</p>
<p>This is a <i>single sentence</i>! Also the phrases "warped model" and "completely contradicted" are again, quite biased.</p>
<p>I think it is clear what the author's position is and that is not the goal of Wikipedia.</p>

<p>I agree with the concerns of the editors on this page and I've added a NPOV tag. This is but one of numerous articles some person or persons wrote on here "selling" Communism. I don't know what some folks' idea of NPOV is, but its definitely not supposed to be the job of Simple English Wikipedia to "sell" Communism, and other such dead horses. This will have to be entirely rewritten in order to be made sensible. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockinblox_c370.html" title="User:Blockinblox">Blockinblox</a> 19:07, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yeah I'm going to have to agree, this text is highly biased, it does not produce a point of view which is fair, True the Soviet Union was never truly <i>Marxist</i> but this does not mean it was not Communist, Communism and Marxism are two different things, and should not be thought to be the same. I personally believe the Soviet Union was a prosperous communist country, but this is just my opinion, and obviously I would not put that in text because that would be a one sided point of view and would also seem biased against opposite views, thus this article is not neutral.</p>

<p>What about <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a> and other anti-authoritarian branches? Communism is not a form of government really, it's a philosophy. Then again, shades of meaning are difficult on simple-english wikipedia.

<dd>I'm changing it back to "government". It fully meets the definition of the word, it still "governs" in five countries in the world today - North Korea, Cuba, etc... Denying it is a government, and claiming it is a "society", sounds too much like rhetoric... and rhetoric is NOT what simple English wikipedia is for. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockinblox_c370.html" title="User:Blockinblox">Blockinblox</a> 13:48, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Anarchism is a philosophy which often advocates communism. Communism is much broader than this article makes it seem. Anyways, society includes government, so why make the article too specific, especially when some people would not consider communism a form of government but a society. It's more than a government, and depending on your definition of government it may not even be that inherently (since many anarchists are also communists). <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 18:39, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If there are secondary definitions of "Communism", it would certainly be fair to include them in a dedicated section, but I'm not sure the intro needs to be rewrittem since "Communist government" is the primary definition, and it is in fact a word used to describe the governments, that are governing today, in N. Korea, etc... <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockinblox_c370.html" title="User:Blockinblox">Blockinblox</a> 20:13, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That is only one type of communism, communism is a broad group of philosophies which advocate collective societies, not necessarilly collectivized governments. Using the term society should cover any form of communism. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 21:24, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While it is hard for me to imagine how communism would be <i>implemented</i> by something other than a government (at least as the world exists today), both a UK<a href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=15486&amp;dict=CALD" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=15486&amp;dict=CALD" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and a US<a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/Communism" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/Communism" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> dictionary seem to agree that communism itself isn't inherently linked to government. EN also has the 'societal theory' discussion of communism at <a href="../../../../en/c/o/m/communism_b219.html" class="extiw" title="en:communism">en:communism</a> with the more implementation-oriented material at <a href="../../../../en/c/o/m/communist_state_b2ae.html" class="extiw" title="en:communist_state">en:communist state</a> and <a href="../../../../en/c/o/m/communist_party_f393.html" class="extiw" title="en:communist_party">en:communist party</a>. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshstart_f212.html" title="User:Freshstart">Freshstart</a> 23:10, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I possess an English textbook from a former Communist country that actually states that the masses of the world must learn English instead of Russian, in order to better combat Capitalism on their own turf. Changing language around through every trick in the book has always been one of the hallmarks of these control freaks, and this should be proof that they are still a threat to everyone else's way of thinking. Remember that Mao had vast numbers of Chinese put to death for the crime of being "set in their ways". He decreed that everyone in China MUST wave his little red book in the air, the book is nothing but insults and accusations and hate speech against Americans. Can you imagine America saying everyone has to wave a particular book in the air, or die??? I bet with all the ton of whitewash you guys are trying to dump on Communism here to make it look perfect and ideal, you aren't going to mention those little facts. <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockinblox_c370.html" title="User:Blockinblox">Blockinblox</a> 00:45, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please assume good faith and do not make personal attacks. I, like Freshstart, am not a communist, at least not the type you are refering to. I'm an anarchist and the Soviet Union murdered and jailed thousands of anarchists for not following the party line (and although I don't know much about the Chinese government, they probably did too). I have absolutely no love for dictators--Lennin, Stalin, Mao, Hitler, Mussolini, Bush--they are the same to me (well, maybe Bush isn't <i>as</i> bad, yet). And anyway, all I'm saying is that communism is a form of society instead of a govenment--how do you get all that other stuff out of that? And actually, I think now that it should be changed to "an idea for society" since communism is a philosophy as well as a type of society. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 04:39, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

But if the article refuses to mention these negative aspects of Communist governments for some reason, you can see why it might look one sided or white washed... Sure mention all the "society" stuff - but if we leave out all the "government" part, we are only giving one half of the story! <a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlockinblox_c370.html" title="User:Blockinblox">Blockinblox</a> 14:05, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Seems like much of the problem here is that the so-called/self-described "communist countries" have never reached the original/actual vision of 'communism'. In general, it seems like power-hungry individuals and/or groups have operated under the guise of "communism" (mostly because of its populist appeal), to actually create various dictatorship/totalitarian/authoritarian regimes.</dd>
<dd>Maybe the para starting "During the 20th century..." should be expanded a bit to something like "During the 20th century, all attempts at creating a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_country.html" title="Communist country">communist country</a> resulted in a <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictatorship.html" title="Dictatorship">dictatorship</a> or authoritarian regime. None of them had the class-less society envisioned by communistic ideals, and many had periods of violent oppression of some or most of its citizens." (obviously needs to be simplified) and leave the rest of the details at <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_state.html" title="Communist state">communist state</a>, since most of the negative things that happened in those countries were due to implementation problems and rejection of much of actual communistic details, not to the goals of literal communism. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshstart_f212.html" title="User:Freshstart">Freshstart</a> 00:58, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your analysis of "communist" countries is right on. I also agree with Blockinblox's comment below this that says that Marx's ideas may have been flawed from the begining towards authoritarianism (I personally believe that any attempt to create a Marxist society will probably turn out badly like the USSR, China, N. Korea, Cambodia, Cuba and many other places demonstrate). The idea of the vanguard (which I believe was actually introduced by Lenin is doomed to create tyranny as far as I am concerned. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 03:41, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
