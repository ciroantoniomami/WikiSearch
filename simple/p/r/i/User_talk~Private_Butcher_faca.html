<p>I visited your English Wikipedia page, Quentin, and left a detailed message about a bad time in my life, where I thought I was being mistreated, but it turned out that had I not been mistreated and left this one church, I would possibly not have gone to another one and later encountered a miracle that actually involved both churches. It was really weird.

<p>Yup, I'm hanging out here as well. I was away for a long time because I was concentrating on the main English site and a Wikicities site. Figured I'm not going to let one sourpuss ruin my fun. Besides, this site needs a LOT more editors. Thanks for the welcome-home! - Lucky 6.9 22:49, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I hear ya, man. I'm an admin at English and at that Wikicities radio control site I just mentioned...but I got rather rudely blown out of the water when I requested adminship here. Hence, I left. &#160;:) The vandalism isn't as bad here as it is at English, but it's getting worse. Jeez, it isn't like I can't be trusted to push the history erase button here as well. We had a very active vandal over at R/C. All of the active users are admins and let me tell you, reverting that clown was a cinch. His IP's are blocked and I think he's pretty much given up. In fact, we revert so fast that the bot-type vandalism we get here and on English simply doesn't exist because any bad change is reverted immediately. - Lucky 6.9 22:57, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The reason that those anonymous users were blocked is that <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpidey_5da8.html" title="User:Spidey">User:Spidey</a>, User:Snake, and User:Nipson are all the same vandal. If you look at the <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=" class="external text" title="http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=&amp;page=" rel="nofollow">Block log</a>, you can see that once those users were blocked, these anonymous users showed up doing the same thing. Now, I could have given them a warning, but given the fact that the vandalism was exactly the same, I wasn't in a mood to wait around. Also, given that <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> blocked User:Testestestest immediately permanently without any edits, why are you picking on me? =) -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERicky81682_f4ed.html" title="User:Ricky81682">Ricky81682</a> (<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERicky81682_072a.html" title="User talk:Ricky81682">talk</a>) 04:51, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Look, when you block a user, then you block his IP address, and then a new user is immediately created, it's kind of obvious what it's for. On a more serious note, I was going to wait until he actually decided to do something and then would bring the hammer down. I was sitting there with the block user setting up. Netoholic was a bit more aggressive. If you want to understand why people are a bit more aggressive here, look over the block log a bit longer and see how long <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERoberto_ed03.html" title="User:Roberto">Roberto</a> got to play around. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERicky81682_f4ed.html" title="User:Ricky81682">Ricky81682</a> (<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERicky81682_072a.html" title="User talk:Ricky81682">talk</a>) 05:42, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Look, I appreciate that you are creating a number of articles, but don't simply copy the categories in the articles over from English unless you are willing to also create the categories and the structure as well. I mean, looking at <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_Hackman_126a.html" title="Gene Hackman">Gene Hackman</a>, you've already created Category:Best Actor Oscar, Category:Best Supporting Actor Oscar Nominee, Category:Best Supporting Actor Oscar, Category:English Americans and <a href="../../../f/i/l/Category%7EFilm_actors_c7d2.html" title="Category:Film actors">Category:Film actors</a> which are not being used anywhere here.

<p>Don't worry about it. Look, if you typically just put some sort of warning on people's talk pages, the vandalism stops, at least for a while. If somebody had warned him and he continued to vandalize, then I would have felt ok blocking him immediately, for a small period of time. Here, he stopped with just a little warning from me, hopefully. If not, I'll bring the hammer down on him. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERicky81682_f4ed.html" title="User:Ricky81682">Ricky81682</a> (<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERicky81682_072a.html" title="User talk:Ricky81682">talk</a>) 03:01, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey Private Butcher, you welcomed me at english wikipedia. I saw you were here, so I started one, I got blocked twice, once on english once on simple.

<p>Private, you don't need to put all the articles into <a href="../../../y/e/a/Category%7EYears_0e74.html" title="Category:Years">Category:Years</a>. If you look at it, the category is already structured into centuries, and decades like at <a href="../../../../en/y/e/a/Category%7EYears_0e74.html" class="extiw" title="en:Category:Years">English</a>. The only reason there are some articles there already is because not all of them have the proper decades and centuries created yet. -- 00:33, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Private, I've cleaned up all those category:years articles. However, I wanted to check with you and <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHailey_C._Shannon_3590.html" title="User:Hailey C. Shannon">Hailey C. Shannon</a>, both of whom seem to be making a lot of the music-related articles here, about your albums categories like <a href="../../../1/9/7/Category%7E1972_albums.html" title="Category:1972 albums">Category:1972 albums</a>. I can create a framework for the category structure, but I probably going to put them as subcategories of <a href="../../../y/e/a/Category%7EYears_in_music_dd75.html" title="Category:Years in music">Category:Years in music</a> like at <a href="../../../../en/1/9/7/Category%7E1972_albums.html" class="extiw" title="en:Category:1972_albums">English</a>, which also allows articles like 1972 in music to have a place.

The main English Wikipedia, and others, are sufficiently good references for albums. I intend to delete any individual album articles within the next week. If you want to, you are free to merge some of the information about those albums (in a compact way) into the artist's main article (ex. <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue_%C3%96yster_Cult_2e36.html" title="Blue Öyster Cult">Blue Öyster Cult</a>). -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 21:35, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
